Jenkins remoting is an executable JAR, 
which implements communication layer in [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) automation server. 
It's being used for master <=> agent and master <=> CLI communications.

In general, this library contains the bootstrap code to bridge separate JVMs into a single semi-shared space.
It includes: TCP-based communication protocols, data serialization, Java classloading.

The library is reusable outside Jenkins.

### Downloads

Jenkins Remoting libraries are supplied as a part of the Jenkins distributions,
and it is recommended to use versions from there to ensure compatibility with your Jenkins instance.
You can download the `${JENKINS_URL}/jnlpJars/agent.jar` from your Jenkins server.
If you need a specific Remoting version, it can be downloaded from the Jenkins artifact repository.
Recent artifacts are available [here](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/releases/org/jenkins-ci/main/remoting).

For usage in Docker, the Jenkins project also provides official agent images which bundle Remoting:
[jenkins/agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/agent) and [jenkins/inbound-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/inbound-agent).
We recommend using and extending these images if you need to run agents in Docker.
