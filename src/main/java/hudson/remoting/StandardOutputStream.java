/**
 * Hint that indicates that we are using {@code stdout} with fd=1 as the stream to write to for the channel.
 *
 * <p>
 * Using stdin/stdout pair for the communication is very convenient for setting up a remote channel,
 * so Jenkins tends to do that, but even with our using {@link System#setOut(PrintStream)} to avoid
 * other parts of the Java code to accidentally corrupt the stream, file descriptor 1 continues to
 * point to the stream we use, so native code in JVM can still accidentally pollute the stream.
 *
 * <p>
 * Fixing that requires the use of dup and close POSIX API calls, which we can only do after the communication
 * gets established and JNA is brought in via remoting. Having {@link Launcher} uses this wrapper class allows
 * us to do that without recreating the stream.
 *
 * <p>
 * When a channel uses {@link StandardOutputStream} to communicate, the convention is to make that object
 * available as a channel property.
