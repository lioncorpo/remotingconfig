/**
 * Creates an {@link ExecutorService} that executes submitted tasks sequentially
 * on top of another generic arbitrary {@link ExecutorService}.
 *
 * <p>
 * In general, {@link ExecutorService} do not place constraints about the order in which submitted
 * tasks are executed. This class takes such an executor service, then creates a stronger guarantee
 * on the order of the executions. Namely, the submitted tasks are executed in the FIFO order,
 * and no two tasks are executed concurrently.
 *
 * <p>
 * A large number of {@link SingleLaneExecutorService}s backed by a single cached executor service
 * is more efficient than the same number of single-threaded {@link ExecutorService} because of
 * the thread sharing.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is named {@link SingleLaneExecutorService} because it's akin to create a driving lane
 * in a high way. You can have many lanes, but each lane is strictly sequentially ordered.
