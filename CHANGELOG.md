##### 3.8

Release date: (May 12, 2017) => Jenkins 2.68

This version of Remoting introduces support for [Work Directories](./docs/workDir.md) ([JENKINS-39370](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39370)). 
This feature has been implemented as a part of the [JENKINS-44108](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-44108) EPIC, which is devoted to better diagnosability of Jenkins agents.

Work Directory mode is disabled by default.
It can be enabled via the `-workDir` argument in the command line.
Once enabled, the following issues are addressed:

* [JENKINS-39369](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39369) -
Write Remoting agent logs to the disk by default.
* [JENKINS-18578](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18578) -
Change the default JAR Cache location from `~/.jenkins/cache/jars` to `${WORK_DIR}/remoting/jarCache`.
* [JENKINS-39130](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39130) - 
If the work directory is not writable, fail the agent initialization.
* [JENKINS-39130](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39130) - 
Add the `-failIfWorkDirIsMissing` flag to CLI. 
It may be useful to prevent startup in the case if the shared directory is not mounted.

See the [Work Directories page](./docs/workDir.md) for more information and migration guidelines.

Other changes:

* [JENKINS-37567](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37567) -
Starting from the `3.8` release, [@oleg-nenashev](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev) will be releasing Remoting JARs signed with his certificate.
  * The certificate should be trusted by all Java versions by default. 
  Please create an issue to Remoting if it's not. 
* [PR #129](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/129) -
Allow configuring `java.util.logging` settings via a property file (`-loggingConfig` or system property). 
See the [Logging page](./docs/logging.md) for more details.
* [PR #157](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/157) - 
Cleanup FindBugs-reported issues in ExportTable implementation (regression in 2.40).
* [PR #153](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/153) -
Prevent `NullPointerException` in `hudson.remoting.Channel.Ref()` when creating a reference to a `null` channel.

Fixed issues:

* [JENKINS-42371](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42371) -
