### Proposing changes

* Create pull requests (PRs) against the master branch.
* Bug fixes or performance improvements may be a subject for backporting to Remoting 2.x.
If you need it, please mention it in the pull request or JIRA ticket. 

### Q&A

Use the [Jenkins developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev) or the <code>#jenkins</code> IRC channel on Freenode to sync-up with remoting developers.
In the case of the mailing list, it's a good practice to CC maintainers directly.
